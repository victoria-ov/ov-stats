# Description: #

The waste dashboard was unable to pull data for 2 Des 2022 due to the data load being too large (Above 6MB limit that CloudFront allows)
The solution to this:
* Use the minified liveSweeperRounds query
* Create a new hook useRepeatQuery, that runs multi queries

188,3,AdamErwee,"Added New Request and View Requests options. Writing and reading data to firestore. View only applies to the user signed in and not an approver. Still need to add functionality to send approver an email notifying them that leave has been requested. 

What was added:
- Header
- Sidebar Actions (New-, View Request and Sign Out)
- Pages (+Functionality): New and View Requests
- Write + Read to FireStore
- Theming (Not fully implemented as this takes time and I'd like more feedback on this before spending/wasting too much time on it)

Note:
- View screen does not yet cater for approver viewing multiple user's requests.
- New Request does not yet send email to approver. **Working on this on separate ticket**

# Description: #

The padding top of the comment box had no padding when there is no comments.  the datepicker had a z-index issue and it seems the date picker is set to 235467234 (something like that) but is still on the same level of z-index of the other components, so I decided to check if the other components needed z-index and they don't so I removed them.

# Description: #

on each table there was a second network request made this was caused by the download table feature and not the pagination feature in the table, the issue was to do with a query that was firing on page load. I fixed it by changing it into a lazy query and then making it a function that is called in a on click handler, this makes sure that the the second network request isn't firing on page load.

Fixed filter bug on the Events page.
